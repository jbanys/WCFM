<p style="font-size: 17px">Pop, Country, Talk Show</p>
<p>Welcome to our country music / talk show&#8230;We bring the all-time-best country tunes to you (though good music in other genres are not off the table). Periodically, we invite people over to the studio to hang out and have a good time.</p>
<p>Country music is a way of life for us. Rowdy Saturday night? We have Toby Keith in the house. Spring Break? Luke Bryan has got you covered. Feeling in love? Listen to some old T-Swift. Whether you are a country fan, have only heard Wagon Wheel, or would never listen to country on your free will- give us a chance. Tune in to our show- we promise you will NOT regret it. Remember always- you&#8217;ve got friends in low places!</p>
<p>Hosts: People</p>
